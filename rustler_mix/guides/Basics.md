# Mix Compiler Basics

The mix compiler takes care of compiling your NIFs along with your project, in addition to providing boilerplate generators.

Setting up a new Rust NIF in your project is fairly easy:

1. Add the `:rustler` dependency to your applications `mix.exs`.
2. Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependency.
3. Run `mix rustler.new` and follow the instructions to generate the boilerplate for your NIF.
4. Enable the `:rustler` mix compiler by adding `compilers: [:rustler] ++ Mix.compilers(),` to the `project` section of your `mix.exs`.
5. Add a configuration entry to the `rustler_crates` section of your `mix.exs`. [See below](#crate-configuration).
6. Load the NIF in your program. [See below](#loading-the-nif).

## Crate configuration

The `rustler_crates` configuration is a keyword list mapping the NIF id (an atom) to the NIF configuration (another keyword list). The nif configuration may contain the following entries:

* `path` - The path to the crate directory relative to the project root.
* `cargo` (:system default) - The rust/cargo version to build the NIF with. May be one of the following:
    * `:system` - Use the version installed on the system.
    * `{:rustup, "rust-version"}` - Use `rustup` to compile the NIF with a spesific version.
    * `{:bin, "path"}` - Use `path` as the cargo command. This is not portable, and you should not normally use this.
* `default_features` (true default) - Boolean indicating if you want the NIF built with or without default cargo features.
* `features` ([] default) - List of binaries indicating what cargo features you want enabled when building.
* `mode` (:release default) - Indicates what cargo build flavor you want.
    * `:release` - Optimized build, normally a LOT faster than debug.
    * `:debug` - Unoptimized debug build with debug assertions and more.

When you are done, the project section might look something like this:

```elixir
def project do
[app: :my_app,
 version: "0.1.0",
 compilers: [:rustler] ++ Mix.compilers,
 rustler_crates: rustler_crates(),
 deps: deps()]
end

defp rustler_crates do
  [io: [
    path: "native/io",
    mode: (if Mix.env == :prod, do: :release, else: :debug),
  ]]
end
```

## Loading the NIF

Loading a Rustler NIF is done in almost the same way as normal NIFs.

The actual loading is done by calling `use Rustler, otp_app: :my_app` in the module you want to load the NIF in.
This sets up the `@on_load` module hook to load the NIF when the module is first
loaded.

```elixir
defmodule MyProject.MyModule do
  use Rustler, otp_app: :my_project, crate: :my_crate

  # When loading a NIF module, dummy clauses for all NIF function are required.
  # NIF dummies usually just error out when called when the NIF is not loaded, as that should never normally happen.
  def my_native_function(_arg1, _arg2), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
end
```

Note that `:crate` is the name in the `[lib]` section of your `Cargo.toml`. The
`:crate` option is optional if your crate and `otp_app` use the same name.
